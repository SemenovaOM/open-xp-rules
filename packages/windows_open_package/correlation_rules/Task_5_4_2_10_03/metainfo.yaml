  Usecases:
    - Monitor for unauthorized execution of custom binaries in non-standard directories.
    - Detect potential malware masquerading as legitimate processes (e.g., SearchIndexer).
  Falsepositives:
    - Legitimate developers testing custom tools named POC.exe in the Public directory.
    - Automated scripts or CI/CD pipelines executing POC.exe during build/deployment processes.
  References: []
  Improvements:
    - Add checks for file hashes (SHA256, IMPHASH) to reduce false positives.
    - Incorporate metadata analysis (e.g., Description or Product fields) to identify masquerading.
